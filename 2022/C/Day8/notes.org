* Notes
** Problem
- Find the tree that has the largest "scenic score"
  + scenic score is determined by multiplying how many trees are visible to the subject tree
** Planning
- each tree will have four variables, one for each cardinal direction
  + maybe use a struct to store the variables?
- outer rows are potentially irrelevant, however the instructions are unclear
** Pseudo Code
- Iterate through the 2D array, element by element
- Use that element as the starting point
